## Running The Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js (version 18 or higher) installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js.

### Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** or download the project files to your local machine.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd your-project-directory
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    Run the following command to install all the packages listed in `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:9002`. You can now open this URL in your web browser to see your portfolio. Any changes you make to the code will automatically reload the page.

      "I’m Kranthi Pedamajji, an AI & Data Engineer specializing in building scalable data pipelines, NLP systems, and production-ready machine learning workflows. My expertise includes Python, PySpark, cloud-based ETL pipelines, and designing AI-driven solutions across structured and unstructured data.",
      "At Quanti LLC, I engineered multi-platform ingestion frameworks and a full NLP enrichment pipeline—including translation, sentiment scoring, SBERT relevance modeling, and entity extraction—to support analytics and automation. I also built backend services and AWS-based workflows supporting large-scale processing.",
      "Previously at CitiusTech (WellSky), I designed and optimized enterprise-grade ETL pipelines using Python, SQL, and PySpark to process healthcare datasets from HL7, FHIR, APIs, and clinical systems. I also implemented data quality frameworks, metadata tracking, and containerized pipelines.",
      "With a Master’s in Data Science from Rowan University, I bring strong experience in machine learning, NLP, and cloud technologies. I’m passionate about building AI systems that combine robust engineering with scalable ML capabilities."
